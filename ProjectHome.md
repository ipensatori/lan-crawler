Still crawling the LAN by hand?


**Lan-Crawler** is a crawler and indexer of public network files and directories shared via SMB shares: Window's shared folders (shares) and UNIX systems running Samba. Meta data is downloaded for films and music. A dynamic web UI is provided for searching files for the uses of the Lan.


The project is quite old and rusty, so if any one wants to take over - please email me at <a href='mailto:sadakov@gmail.com'>sadakov@gmail.com</a>.
